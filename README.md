## Using Docker [recommended ‚òëÔ∏è]
1. You'll need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed in your machine
1. Build a docker image using the command bellow 
   ```yaml
   # This assume you are in the root of the directory project
    docker build --pull --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t socialshare:latest .
   ``` 
    While docker is building the image pass to the next step (_**Running the mongoDb server**_)
1. Pull the latest image of MongoDB server, run it in a docker container and expose it to the default port  using the commande bellow 
   Open a new terminal and run:
   ```yaml
   docker run --rm --name mongodb -d -p27017:27017 mongo
   ```
 1. If the command from the step 2 and 3 finished to run, run the Web server and expose the port 3000 to your host. ( ‚ùó make sure that the port 3000 is not used by another app)
     ```yaml
     docker run -it --rm --name social-share -p3000:3000 socialshare
     ```
### Stoping the docker containers
After these steps, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
